Project Title: Digital Clock

Day 6: Digital Clock

Description: The Digital Clock is an interactive web application that displays the current time in a clear and modern format. This project emphasizes real-time functionality and user preferences, allowing users to easily toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.

Functionalities:

Real-Time Time Display: The clock updates every second to show the current hours, minutes, and seconds.

Format Toggle: Users can switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats with the click of a button, enhancing usability and catering to different preferences.

Responsive Design: The clock is designed to be visually appealing and centered on the screen, making it easy to read.

This project represents my sixth accomplishment in the 30 Days of 30 Projects challenge, a part of the Governor IT Program focused on developing practical coding skills. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of React, state management, and user interaction design, creating a functional and stylish digital clock for everyday use.
